summary: |
  Web application development has been my passion for about 10 years.
  I am a full stack engineer, being equally good at building backend systems or writing javascript and css on the client side.
  I also enjoy TDD and pair programming.

  I always felt that it is important to pay attention to details and keep things clean and simple.
  And I love ruby for that.
